## Top Free Agents - Waiver Wire Targets

### Loyola Chicago (4 games in P15!)

| Player | Composite Z | Key Strengths | Priority |
|--------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Braeden Speed** | **+5.02** | PTS (+1.79), AST (+1.66), 3PT (+1.02), FT% (+0.90) | **#1 PRIORITY** |
| Jordan Stiemke | +2.41 | 3PT (+1.16), FT% (+1.30) | High |
| Jacob Theodosiou | +2.00 | PTS (+1.53), AST (+1.47), ST (+2.37) | High |
| Emmett Adair | +1.69 | PTS (+1.40), REB (+1.25), 3PT (+0.73) | Medium |

### Other Notable Free Agents

| Player | Team | Composite Z | P15 Games | Key Strengths |
|--------|------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Jaiden Glover-Toscano | Saint Joseph's | +4.13 | 2 | 3PT (+2.70), PTS (+1.92) |
| Dion Brown | Saint Louis | +2.70 | 2 | AdjFG% (+1.61), REB (+1.25) |
| David Dixon | Duquesne | +2.65 | 2 | BLK (+2.27), AdjFG% (+1.21) |

## Recommended Moves

### Move 1: Drop Tyrell Ward (-4.03) for Braeden Speed (+5.02)
- **Net swing: +9.05 composite z-score**
- Speed has 4 games vs Ward's 2 — doubles the counting stat contribution
- Speed is elite in our strength categories (PTS, AST) AND helps neutral cats (3PT, FT%)

### Move 2 (if Brewer is out): Drop Brewer for another Loyola player
- Stiemke helps FT% and 3PT (our neutral cats we could push to wins)
- Theodosiou helps ST (could flip a category) and has elite AST/PTS

### Sit Strategy
- With 16 GP and 15 max, bench **Ward** (or his replacement) for 1 game if not dropped
- If Speed is picked up (4 games), we'd have 18 GP — need to manage carefully

## Key Takeaways

1. **We are heavy underdogs** against any top-4 team. Our best realistic matchup is Fordham (4-5 projected).
2. **Braeden Speed is the #1 waiver priority** — best free agent in the league AND has a 4-game schedule.
3. **Our winning formula:** Lock in PTS/AST/REB, compete in 2 of {AdjFG%, 3PTM, FT%, ST} to get to 5 wins.
4. **Punt BLK and TO** — we're too far behind in these to compete without gutting our strengths.
5. **The Loyola schedule edge is massive** — every Loyola player we can roster gets 4 games of production.
