# Playoff Analysis v2 - February 14, 2026

**Team:** Sick-Os Revenge (8th seed, 35W-78L-4T)
**Playoff Round 1:** Period 15 (Feb 16-22)
**R1 Opponent:** Boardwalk Hall is on Fire (#5 seed, 50W-61L-6T)
**Waiver Budget:** $100 (unused)
**Data:** Clean pipeline (conference-based filtering, 203 players, 268 games, 0 mismatches)

> **Note:** This replaces the v1 analysis which was built on contaminated data (Loyola Maryland leaking into Loyola Chicago stats). The old analysis falsely showed Loyola Chicago with 4 games in P15 and built its entire strategy around that edge. Clean data shows Loyola Chicago has 2 games like most teams.

## Period 15 Schedule

All 14 A-10 teams have **2 games** in P15 except:
- **George Mason: 1 game** (Feb 18 only)
- **George Washington: 1 game** (Feb 17 only)

This means no team has a schedule edge. All our players' teams have 2 games. Total roster games = 16 (8 players x 2 games), with a 15 GP cap, meaning **one player must sit one game**.

| Team | Games | Dates |

## Our Roster

| Player | Team | P15 G | z-Comp | PPG | RPG | APG | 3PM | STL | BLK | TO | AdjFG% | FT% | Assessment |
|--------|------|-------|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|-----|------------|
| Frank Mitchell | St. Bon | 2 | **+4.90** | 16.1 | 9.8 | 3.0 | 0.0 | 1.4 | 0.6 | 2.5 | .541 | .642 | Ace. PTS/REB/AST/ST/BLK. Bad FT%, zero 3PM |
| Jonah Hinton | URI | 2 | **+2.38** | 13.5 | 3.1 | 2.2 | 2.7 | 0.6 | 0.2 | 2.1 | .500 | .812 | 3PT specialist. Good FT%. Slumping lately |
| Dasonte Bowen | St. Bon | 2 | **+1.88** | 10.5 | 3.0 | 4.7 | 0.4 | 1.1 | 0.0 | 1.8 | .468 | .873 | AST anchor, best FT% on roster |
| Jerome Brewer Jr. | La Salle | 2 | **+1.24** | 11.8 | 4.4 | 0.8 | 1.0 | 0.6 | 0.2 | 0.9 | .543 | .765 | Solid. **DTD - injured**. Low TO is valuable |
| Christian Henry | Fordham | 2 | **-0.02** | 11.5 | 3.5 | 5.2 | 1.1 | 1.3 | 0.1 | 2.8 | .437 | .606 | AST/ST but tanks AdjFG%, FT%, TO |
| Alex Williams | Duquesne | 2 | **-0.28** | 7.6 | 3.0 | 0.7 | 1.1 | 0.5 | 0.1 | 0.7 | .529 | .836 | Low minutes but surging recently |
| John Hugley IV | Duquesne | 2 | **-1.67** | 10.3 | 4.4 | 1.6 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 1.8 | .548 | .734 | **Drop candidate.** Cratering hard |
| Tyrell Ward | VCU | 2 | **-3.62** | 6.0 | 2.2 | 0.4 | 0.7 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 1.1 | .565 | .652 | **Drop candidate.** Low everything |

**Injury watch:** Jerome Brewer Jr. (La Salle) is DTD. If he misses P15 we have only 7 active players (14 GP, under the 15 cap), which actually simplifies GP management but costs production.

## Opponent Scouting: Boardwalk Hall is on Fire

| Player | Team | P15 G | z-Comp | PPG | RPG | APG | 3PM | STL | BLK | TO |
|--------|------|-------|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Tarence Guinyard | Duquesne | 2 | **+6.34** | 16.6 | 3.4 | 5.2 | 2.3 | 1.2 | 0.0 | 2.2 |
| Robbie Avila | Saint Louis | 2 | **+6.07** | 12.4 | 4.4 | 4.4 | 1.8 | 0.7 | 0.4 | 1.8 |
| Rikus Schulte | Fordham | 2 | **+4.01** | 11.0 | 9.2 | 1.3 | 0.2 | 1.4 | 0.5 | 1.7 |
| Parker Friedrichsen | Davidson | 2 | **+2.34** | 10.2 | 2.5 | 1.5 | 1.9 | 1.4 | 0.0 | 1.2 |
| Nyk Lewis | VCU | 2 | **+1.60** | 8.5 | 4.0 | 1.8 | 1.2 | 1.2 | 0.0 | 1.0 |
| Aiden Argabright | Richmond | 2 | **+1.42** | 10.6 | 2.0 | 2.1 | 0.8 | 1.2 | 0.0 | 0.7 |
| Jaeden Marshall | La Salle | 2 | **+0.44** | 12.4 | 2.2 | 1.3 | 1.9 | 0.3 | 0.0 | 1.1 |
| Ashton Walker | La Salle | 2 | **-2.65** | 7.4 | 3.4 | 3.3 | 0.5 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 1.7 |

**Boardwalk's strengths:** Guinyard + Avila are elite. Top of league in 3PTM, AdjFG%, STL, AST. Extremely well-balanced roster with 6 of 8 players z-positive.

**Boardwalk's weaknesses:** Almost zero BLK production (1.8 projected). Only Schulte and Avila contribute any blocks. Their TO efficiency is good (22.8 total) because most players are low-TO.

## Baseline Matchup Projection (P15)

### Sick-Os Revenge vs Boardwalk Hall: **2-7-0 LOSS**

| Category | Us | Them | Winner | Margin | Assessment |
|----------|---:|-----:|--------|-------:|------------|
| AdjFG% | .511 | .536 | THEM | .025 | Significant gap |
| 3PTM | 15.0 | 21.2 | THEM | 6.2 | Blown out — Guinyard/Avila/Marshall/Friedrichsen |
| FT% | .730 | .760 | THEM | .031 | Moderate gap |
| PTS | 174.6 | 178.2 | THEM | 3.6 | Competitive |
| REB | **66.8** | 62.2 | **US** | 4.6 | Frank Mitchell + Hugley + Brewer |
| AST | 37.2 | 41.8 | THEM | 4.6 | Guinyard + Avila dominate |
| ST | 12.4 | 16.8 | THEM | 4.4 | They have ST depth across roster |
| **BLK** | **3.2** | **1.8** | **US** | **1.4** | **SWING** - our only close win besides REB |
| TO | 27.4 | 22.8 | THEM | 4.6 | Henry's 2.8 TO/g kills us |

**Summary:** Without moves, we get blown out. We only win REB (Mitchell's 9.8 RPG) and BLK (barely). We lose 7 categories, several by significant margins. Boardwalk is simply a much better team on paper.

### Matchup vs All Opponents (P15)

| Opponent | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Back to the Big East | 3-5-1 |
| Boardwalk Hall is on Fire | **2-7-0** |
| Brian | 2-7-0 |
| Fordham U Christian Knights | 4-5-0 |
| Frank's Quality | 2-7-0 |
| Nishy Baby | 1-8-0 |
| We Don't Talk About Linda Bruno | 2-7-0 |

We're the worst team in the league. The only matchup close to competitive is Fordham (4-5). This is an uphill battle.

## Category Ranks (Latest Period)

| Category | Sick-Os Rank | Boardwalk Rank | Notes |
|----------|:---:|:---:|-------|
| AdjFG% | 3 | 1 | They're elite |
| 3PTM | 6 | 2 | Massive gap |
| FT% | 3 | 5 | One of our better cats |
| PTS | 6 | 2 | They outscore us |
| REB | 6 | 2 | Close despite ranks (our roster changed) |
| AST | 5 | 3 | They have the playmakers |
| ST | 6 | 7 | Both bad — but they have more steals in P15 |
| BLK | 8 | 7 | Both bad — we edge it |
| TO | 7 | 3 | Our worst cat |

## Swing Category Analysis

Categories sorted by closeness of margin:

| Category | Margin | Winner | Flippable? |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| **BLK** | **1.4** | **US** | **SWING** - protect this, it's close |
| PTS | 3.6 | THEM | Possible to flip with right adds |
| ST | 4.4 | THEM | Hard to flip |
| AST | 4.6 | THEM | Very hard |
| REB | 4.6 | US | Safe win |
| TO | 4.6 | THEM | Hard — need to remove Henry |
| AdjFG% | .025 | THEM | Flippable if we fix lineup |
| FT% | .031 | THEM | Flippable if we fix lineup |
| 3PTM | 6.2 | THEM | Blown out, not flippable |

**To win 5-4 we need to flip 3 categories from THEM to US.**

Our locked wins: **REB** (safe), **BLK** (swing but likely).
Most flippable: **PTS** (3.6 margin), **AdjFG%** (.025), **FT%** (.031), **TO** (4.6 but removing Henry helps massively).

## Recency Analysis

### Our Roster - Trends

| Player | L5 z | L7 z | L10 z | Season z | Trend |
|--------|------|------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Alex Williams** | **+4.30** | +2.01 | +1.94 | -0.28 | **Surging hard** |
| Dasonte Bowen | +2.69 | +4.14 | +2.92 | +1.88 | Trending up |
| **Tyrell Ward** | **+2.02** | +0.59 | -0.56 | -3.62 | **Recent hot streak** (L5 only) |
| Christian Henry | +1.40 | +0.82 | -0.90 | -0.02 | Inconsistent |
| Jerome Brewer Jr. | +1.35 | +2.23 | +2.17 | +1.24 | Steady/up |
| Frank Mitchell | +3.21 | +3.92 | +3.37 | +4.90 | Still great, slight regression |
| **Jonah Hinton** | **-1.20** | +0.45 | +0.46 | +2.38 | **Slumping** |
| **John Hugley IV** | **-5.92** | **-5.57** | **-5.65** | -1.67 | **Cratering.** Worst on roster by far |

**Key takeaways:**
- **Hugley is a clear drop.** His L5/L7/L10 z-scores are all deeply negative (-5.5 to -5.9). He's not coming back.
- **Alex Williams is breaking out.** L5 z of +4.30 is elite. If this is real, he's our 3rd-best player.
- **Ward's hot streak is only 5 games deep** — L7 and L10 still negative. Unreliable.
- **Hinton is cold** but his season line is strong. He may bounce back.

### Top Free Agents - Trends

| Player | Team | L5 z | L7 z | Season z | Trend |
|--------|------|------|------|----------|-------|
| **Jadrian Tracey** | VCU | **+3.07** | +1.72 | +0.80 | **Hot** |
| **David Dixon** | Duquesne | **+2.94** | +4.29 | +2.80 | **Consistently good** |
| **Roor Akhuar** | Fordham | **+2.05** | +1.68 | +1.09 | **Trending up** |
| **Austin Williford** | St. Joseph's | **+1.94** | +1.71 | +1.26 | **Steady/up** |
| Deuce Jones | St. Joseph's | +1.69 | +3.19 | +2.29 | Solid |
| Dion Brown | Saint Louis | -2.57 | -3.06 | +2.59 | **Cratering** |
| Hunter Adam | Davidson | -2.24 | -2.66 | +0.57 | **Cratering** |
| Tre Dinkins | GWash | -4.49 | -2.77 | +1.13 | **Cratering** |
| Bubu Benjamin | GWash | -4.22 | -4.16 | +0.12 | **Cratering** |

**Key takeaways:**
- **David Dixon is the safest FA pickup.** Consistently elite (L5=+2.94, L7=+4.29, Season=+2.80). BLK specialist (1.4 BPG!).
- **Jadrian Tracey is surging** and has 2 games (VCU). Good all-around.
- **Dion Brown, Hunter Adam, and Brady Dunlap** look good on season z-scores but are ALL trending down. Risky picks.
- **Deuce Jones** has the highest season z (+2.29) among FAs and is steady/trending up across windows.

## Swap Simulations

### Best Single Swaps (vs Boardwalk Hall)

| Drop | Add | Team | Result | Delta |
|------|-----|------|--------|-------|
| Tyrell Ward | Deuce Jones | St. Joseph's | **4-5-0** | **+2** |
| Jerome Brewer Jr. | Deuce Jones | St. Joseph's | **4-5-0** | **+2** |
| Christian Henry | Deuce Jones | St. Joseph's | **4-5-0** | **+2** |
| Alex Williams | Deuce Jones | St. Joseph's | **4-5-0** | **+2** |
| Tyrell Ward | Dion Brown | Saint Louis | 3-6-0 | +1 |
| Tyrell Ward | Jadrian Tracey | VCU | 3-6-0 | +1 |
| Tyrell Ward | Jack Whitbourn | Fordham | 3-6-0 | +1 |
| Christian Henry | Dion Brown | Saint Louis | 3-6-0 | +1 |

**Deuce Jones is the #1 waiver target.** He's the ONLY single add that gets us to 4-5. His profile (15.8 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.3 3PM, 1.3 STL) directly addresses our weaknesses in PTS, STL, and 3PTM.

But 4-5 is still a loss. We need 2 moves to get to 5-4.

### Best 2-Player Swaps (vs Boardwalk Hall)

| Drop | Add | Result | Delta |
|------|-----|--------|-------|
| **Ward + Henry** | **Joe Grahovac (StBon) + Hunter Adam (Dav)** | **5-4-0 WIN** | **+3** |
| **Ward + Henry** | **Hunter Adam (Dav) + Brady Dunlap (StLou)** | **5-4-0 WIN** | **+3** |
| Bowen + Henry | David Dixon (Duq) + Hunter Adam (Dav) | 4-5-0 | +2 |
| Bowen + Henry | Joe Grahovac (StBon) + Roor Akhuar (Ford) | 4-5-0 | +2 |
| Bowen + Henry | Joe Grahovac (StBon) + Hunter Adam (Dav) | 4-5-0 | +2 |
| Bowen + Henry | Austin Williford (StJos) + Roor Akhuar (Ford) | 4-5-0 | +2 |
| Bowen + Henry | Hunter Adam (Dav) + Brady Dunlap (StLou) | 4-5-0 | +2 |
| Hugley + Ward | David Dixon (Duq) + Deuce Jones (StJos) | 4-5-0 | +2 |
| Hugley + Ward | Dion Brown (StLou) + Deuce Jones (StJos) | 4-5-0 | +2 |

**The only paths to 5-4 require dropping Ward + Henry** and adding specific combinations of players who boost our percentage categories (AdjFG%, FT%) and/or TO while not cratering our counting stats.

### Why Ward + Henry Drops Work

Christian Henry is a double-edged sword:
- **Provides:** 5.2 APG (our #1 AST source), 1.3 STL, 11.5 PPG
- **Costs:** .437 AdjFG% (worst on roster), .606 FT% (worst on roster), 2.8 TO/g (worst on roster)

Removing Henry **flips AdjFG%, FT%, and TO** because he was single-handedly dragging down all three percentage/efficiency categories. The counting stat losses (AST, PTS, STL) are partially offset by the adds.

Ward is simply a negative-value player (z=-3.62). Replacing him with almost anyone is an upgrade.

---

## Recency Concerns with 5-4 Paths

### Path A: Drop Ward + Henry, Add Grahovac + Hunter Adam → 5-4-0

**Problem:** Both Hunter Adam (L5 z=-2.24, L7 z=-2.66) and Joe Grahovac (L5 z=-0.47, L7 z=+0.44) are trending DOWN. Hunter Adam is particularly cold.

- Grahovac: Season z=+2.02, but BLK specialist (1.7 BPG) — his value is structural, not streaky
- Hunter Adam: Season z=+0.57, currently ice cold — **HIGH RISK**

### Path B: Drop Ward + Henry, Add Hunter Adam + Brady Dunlap → 5-4-0

**Same problem:** Hunter Adam is cold. Dunlap (L5 z=-0.35, L7 z=-0.30) is neutral/slightly cold.

### The Recency Dilemma

The players who project to 5-4-0 in our simulations are trending cold. The players who are trending HOT (Jadrian Tracey, David Dixon, Austin Williford) only get us to 3-6-0 or 4-5-0 in the sims.

This is because the 5-4 paths work by **fixing our efficiency categories** (AdjFG%, FT%, TO), not by adding raw firepower. The hot players are hot in counting stats, not efficiency.

---

## Recommended Strategy

### Primary Plan: Aggressive 2-Drop

**Drop:** Tyrell Ward + Christian Henry
**Add:** Joe Grahovac (St. Bonaventure) + Best Available Efficiency Player

**Rationale:** Removing Henry fixes our biggest structural problem (he's a pct-cat poison pill). Ward is dead weight. Even if the exact sim targets (Hunter Adam, Brady Dunlap) are cold, the *direction* is right — we need to improve AdjFG%, FT%, and TO, not add more counting-stat volume.

**Bid strategy:** Grahovac is the key piece (1.7 BPG protects our BLK swing cat + good efficiency). Bid $50+ on Grahovac. Use remaining budget on the 2nd add.

**Target priority for 2nd add (efficiency focus):**
1. Hunter Adam (Davidson, 2G) — if he breaks out of his slump, this is the 5-4 path
2. Brady Dunlap (Saint Louis, 2G) — safer floor, 1.6 3PM helps
3. Roor Akhuar (Fordham, 2G) — trending up, good AdjFG%, has some BLK
4. Austin Williford (Saint Joseph's, 2G) — steady and trending up

### Alternative Plan: Safe 1-Drop

If only making one move:

**Drop:** Tyrell Ward (or John Hugley IV)
**Add:** Deuce Jones (Saint Joseph's)

**Projected result:** 4-5-0 (still a loss, but competitive)

Deuce Jones is the single highest-impact add available. 15.8 PPG, 1.3 STL, 1.3 3PM, 3.3 APG — he's an elite all-around player. His recency is solid (L5=+1.69, L7=+3.19).

### Who to Bench (GP Management)

With 8 players x 2 games = 16 GP against a 15 GP cap, one player sits one game.

**Bench candidate:** Alex Williams (if keeping current roster) or the weakest add. Despite Williams' hot streak, his season line is still the weakest counting-stat contributor.

If we execute the 2-drop plan and have 8 players with 2G each, we still bench one player-game. Bench whoever has the worst matchup on that specific game day.

## Tournament Arc (P15 → P16 → P17)

### P15 (Round 1) - This Week
Goal: Beat Boardwalk Hall. Strategy above.

### P16 (Round 2) - If We Advance
Likely opponent: **Back to the Big East** (#3 seed) or **Nishy Baby** (#4 seed)

Schedule notes for P16:
- **Fordham, VCU, Richmond, Loyola Chicago: 1 game only**
- All others: 2 games

If we drop Henry (Fordham) he's gone for P16 anyway since Fordham has 1G. Ward (VCU) would also only have 1G in P16.

This means our drops for P15 are also good for P16 — the players we're cutting have bad P16 schedules.

**Key P16 consideration:** St. Bonaventure, Duquesne, La Salle, Rhode Island, Saint Joseph's all have 2G. Our core (Mitchell, Bowen, Hinton, Brewer, Williams) are all on 2G teams. Good for continuity.

### P17 (Round 3/Championship)
All 14 teams have 2 games. Full slate. No schedule edges. Pure roster strength matters.

## Historical Performance (Last 5 Periods)

### Sick-Os Revenge
| Period | W-L-T | PTS | REB | AST | 3PTM |
|--------|-------|-----|-----|-----|------|
| P10 | 2-7-0 | 84 | 33 | 25 | 3 |
| P11 | 0-8-1 | 75 | 33 | 19 | 4 |
| P12 | 2-7-0 | 96 | 32 | 27 | 3 |
| P13 | **5-4-0** | 100 | 37 | 27 | 4 |
| P14 | 3-6-0 | 98 | 31 | 22 | 9 |

### Boardwalk Hall is on Fire
| Period | W-L-T | PTS | REB | AST | 3PTM |
|--------|-------|-----|-----|-----|------|
| P10 | 6-3-0 | 117 | 50 | 42 | 17 |
| P11 | 3-6-0 | 139 | 42 | 31 | 21 |
| P12 | 2-6-1 | 129 | 54 | 43 | 14 |
| P13 | 4-5-0 | 126 | 44 | 18 | 16 |
| P14 | 5-4-0 | 134 | 54 | 24 | 14 |

**Note:** Boardwalk had a rough P12 (2-6-1) and P13 (4-5-0), showing they're beatable. But they've bounced back with 5-4 in P14. Their 3PTM production is consistently high (14-21 range). We only had 3-4 threes most weeks until P14's 9.

---

## Risk Assessment

| Factor | Risk Level | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Baseline projection | **HIGH** | 2-7 loss without moves |
| Optimal 2-drop plan | **MEDIUM** | 5-4 projected win, but depends on cold players performing |
| Safe 1-drop plan | **LOW** | 4-5 loss but minimal downside |
| Brewer injury | **MEDIUM** | DTD status — if he sits, we lose his production |
| Opponent countermoves | **LOW** | Boardwalk has $100 budget and a strong roster — they may not need to make moves |
| Recency accuracy | **MEDIUM** | Hot/cold streaks may not persist over a 1-week sample |

---

## Final Recommendation

### Execute the 2-drop aggressive plan:

1. **Drop Tyrell Ward** (z=-3.62, dead weight)
2. **Drop Christian Henry** (z=-0.02, but .437 AdjFG% / .606 FT% / 2.8 TO per game is actively harmful)
3. **Add Joe Grahovac** ($50+ bid) — 1.7 BPG locks BLK cat, good efficiency, St. Bonaventure = 2G
4. **Add best available efficiency player** — Hunter Adam, Brady Dunlap, Roor Akhuar, or Austin Williford depending on who clears waivers

**Projected result: 5-4 WIN** (if Grahovac + efficiency add perform to season averages)

**Fallback:** If only one add clears, prioritize Deuce Jones over Grahovac for the single-add scenario (gets us to 4-5, which is at least competitive — a couple of hot games from Mitchell or Hinton could flip a swing category).

**The math is clear:** We can't win on counting stats — Boardwalk has Guinyard (+6.34z) and Avila (+6.07z) who are elite. Our path to victory is through efficiency: fix AdjFG%, FT%, and TO by removing Henry, keep our structural advantages in REB and BLK, and steal PTS if possible.
