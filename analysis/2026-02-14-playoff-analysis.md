# Playoff Analysis - February 14, 2026

**Team:** Sick-Os Revenge (8th seed)
**Playoff Round 1:** Period 15 (Feb 16-22)
**R1 Opponent:** Boardwalk Hall is on Fire (#5 seed)
**R2 Opponent (if we advance):** Likely Back to the Big East (#4 seed)
**Waiver Budget:** $100 (unused)

---

## Playoff Bracket

Top 2 seeds (Frank's Quality, Linda Bruno) are auto-promoted — not in the playoff. Seeds 3-4 (Back to Big East, Nishy Baby) get first-round byes.

| Round 1 | | |
|---------|---|---|
| **#5 Boardwalk Hall is on Fire** | vs | **#8 Sick-Os Revenge** |
| #6 Fordham U Christian Knights | vs | #7 Brian |

Winners advance to Round 2 (Period 16) vs the bye teams. Round 3 is Period 17 (Mar 2-8).

> **CORRECTION (late Feb 14):** The original analysis below assumed Fordham was our R1 opponent based on points-based standings from our data (through P13). Live Fantrax standings use **category win percentage**, and with P14 in progress (ending Feb 15), Boardwalk Hall (#5) has overtaken Fordham (#6). See "Standings Correction" section for details.

## League Standings (Live, P14 in progress)

Rankings by category win percentage (Fantrax tiebreaker), with projected post-P14 in parentheses:

| Seed | Team | Record (thru P13) | P14 Current | Projected Post-P14 | Status |
|------|------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| 1 | Frank's Quality | 73-38-6 (.650) | 2-5-2 | 75-43-8 (.595) | Auto-promoted |
| 2 | We Don't Talk About Linda Bruno | 72-41-4 (.632) | 4-5-0 | 76-46-4 (.603) | Auto-promoted |
| 3 | Back to the Big East | 66-47-4 (.581) | 6-2-1 | 72-49-5 (.571) | R1 bye |
| 4 | Nishy Baby | 63-47-7 (.568) | 6-3-0 | 69-50-7 (.548) | R1 bye |
| 5 | **Boardwalk Hall is on Fire** | 50-61-6 (.453) | 5-4-0 | 55-65-6 (.437) | **R1 play-in** |
| 6 | Fordham U Christian Knights | 51-62-4 (.453) | 2-6-1 | 53-68-5 (.421) | R1 play-in |
| 7 | Brian | 38-74-5 (.346) | 5-2-2 | 43-76-7 (.341) | R1 play-in |
| 8 | **Sick-Os Revenge** | **35-78-4 (.316)** | 3-6-0 | **38-84-4 (.302)** | **R1 play-in** |

**Key:** Boardwalk and Fordham were tied at .453 entering P14. With Boardwalk winning 5-4 and Fordham losing 2-6-1, Boardwalk will finish #5. P14 ends Feb 15 — scores unlikely to swing dramatically (4 players with 1 game left, 2 Nishy players with games).

## Round 1 Opponent: Fordham University Christian Knights

### Their Roster

| Player | Team | P15 Games | PPG | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | Z-Comp |
|--------|------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Trey Green | Saint Louis | 2 | 12.1 | 3.2 | 1.8 | 1.0 | 0.0 | +6.86 |
| Kory Mincy | George Mason | 1 | 15.2 | 3.5 | 3.2 | 1.1 | 0.0 | +6.31 |
| Garrett Johnson | George Washington | 1 | 13.0 | 3.9 | 1.2 | 0.5 | 0.2 | +3.17 |
| Amael L'Etang | Dayton | 2 | 11.2 | 5.8 | 1.2 | 0.4 | 1.2 | +1.59 |
| Myles Corey | Rhode Island | 2 | 9.9 | 2.9 | 1.8 | 1.3 | 0.4 | +1.44 |
| Justin Moore | **Loyola Chicago** | **4** | 11.4 | 2.1 | 3.7 | 0.7 | 0.1 | -2.02 |
| Fatt Hill | George Mason | 1 | 10.8 | 3.6 | 2.0 | 0.8 | 0.2 | -1.16 |
| Cameron Crawford | Duquesne | 2 | 5.6 | 2.1 | 1.1 | 0.6 | 0.1 | -2.39 |

**Their GP:** 15 (exactly at cap). They have two elite players (Green +6.86, Mincy +6.31) but Mincy/Hill/Johnson only have 1 game each. Their Loyola Chicago player (Moore) has 4 games but is a weak player (Z: -2.02).

### Baseline Matchup: 4-5 (we lose by 1 category)

| Category | Us | Them | Gap | Status |
|----------|-----|------|-----|--------|
| ST | 12.0 | 11.8 | 0.2 | **WINNING** (barely) |
| TO | 27.4 | 26.9 | 0.5 | LOSING (close) |
| BLK | 3.0 | 4.2 | 1.2 | LOSING |
| AST | 36.8 | 33.0 | 3.8 | **WINNING** |
| 3PTM | 14.6 | 20.8 | 6.2 | LOSING |
| PTS | 171.4 | 162.2 | 9.2 | **WINNING** |
| REB | 65.8 | 47.4 | 18.4 | **WINNING** |
| AdjFG% | .511 | .531 | .021 | LOSING |
| FT% | .724 | .767 | .044 | LOSING |

**We win 4, need to flip 1 more.** Closest flippable cats: TO (0.5 gap), BLK (1.2 gap), AdjFG% (.021 gap), FT% (.044 gap).

## Swap Simulations vs Fordham

### Swap A: Drop Ward, Add Speed (Loyola 4G)

**Result: 4-5 (no change)**

Speed massively boosts our strengths and narrows every gap, but doesn't flip the 5th category. FT% closes to -0.007 and 3PTM closes to -1.0, but both still losses.

### Swap B: Drop Ward+Brewer, Add Speed+Stiemke (Loyola 4G each) -- RECOMMENDED

**Result: 7-2 WIN**

| Category | Us | Them | Margin | Result |
|----------|-----|------|--------|--------|
| PTS | 234.6 | 162.2 | +72.4 | **WIN** |
| REB | 82.8 | 47.4 | +35.4 | **WIN** |
| AST | 53.6 | 33.0 | +20.6 | **WIN** |
| ST | 17.4 | 11.8 | +5.6 | **WIN** |
| 3PTM | 24.6 | 20.8 | +3.8 | **WIN** |
| BLK | 5.0 | 4.2 | +0.8 | **WIN** |
| FT% | .770 | .767 | +.003 | **WIN** (tight) |
| AdjFG% | .505 | .531 | -.026 | LOSS (punt) |
| TO | 35.8 | 26.9 | -8.9 | LOSS (punt) |

Wins 7 categories. Stiemke's elite FT% (+1.30 z) and 3PT (+1.16 z) flip those cats from losses to wins. GP would be 20, so we need to manage sit decisions carefully (only 15 GP allowed).

### Swap C: Drop Ward+Brewer, Add Speed+Theodosiou (Loyola 4G each)

**Result: 5-3-1 WIN**

Wins PTS, REB, AST, ST, 3PTM. Ties BLK exactly. Loses FT%, AdjFG%, TO. Riskier — the BLK tie is fragile and FT% stays a loss.

### Swap D: Drop Ward+Brewer, Add Speed+Adair (Loyola 4G each)

**Result: 5-3-1 WIN**

Wins PTS, REB, AST, ST, 3PTM. Ties BLK. FT% barely a loss (-.002). Similar risk profile to Swap C.

## Top Free Agents - Waiver Wire Targets

### Loyola Chicago (4 games in P15!)

| Player | Composite Z | Key Strengths | Priority |
|--------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Braeden Speed** | **+5.02** | PTS (+1.79), AST (+1.66), 3PT (+1.02), FT% (+0.90) | **#1 PRIORITY** |

## Recommended Waiver Plan

### Move 1: Drop Tyrell Ward (-4.03) for Braeden Speed (+5.02)
- **Bid: $50** — he's the best free agent in the league with a 4-game schedule
- Net swing: +9.05 composite z-score
- Must-have regardless of which combo we go with

### Move 2: Drop Jerome Brewer Jr. (DTD) for Jordan Stiemke (+2.41)
- **Bid: $25-30** — flips FT% and 3PTM from losses to wins vs Fordham
- Brewer is injured (DTD) and only has 2 games at La Salle
- Stiemke's FT% (+1.30 z) is what pushes us from 4-5 to 7-2

### Budget After R1: ~$20-25 remaining for Rounds 2-3

### GP Management
With Speed+Stiemke we'd have 20 GP (max 15). Sit strategy:
- Bench lowest-value players on days with the most active players
- Prioritize getting full games from Speed, Stiemke, Mitchell, Hinton, Bowen, Henry

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **R1 opponent is Fordham (#5 seed)** — the most winnable matchup in the bracket.
2. **We already win 4 of 9 categories at baseline** (PTS, REB, AST, ST). Need to flip just 1 more.
3. **Speed alone isn't enough** — narrows every gap but doesn't flip a 5th category vs Fordham.
4. **Speed + Stiemke = 7-2 projected win.** Stiemke's FT% and 3PT are the difference-makers.
5. **Punt AdjFG% and TO** — we can't win these and shouldn't try.
6. **Fordham already has a Loyola player** (Justin Moore, 4G) — we need the double-Loyola pickup to match their volume.
7. **FT% is the swing category** — it's the tightest margin in the Speed+Stiemke scenario (+.003). One bad free throw night could flip it.

## Recency-Weighted Analysis (Last 10 Games)

Full-season averages can mask recent trends — players heating up or falling off. This section re-runs the full analysis using each player's **last 10 games** instead of their full season line, and compares the results.

### Our Roster: Full Season vs Last 10

| Player | PPG Full | PPG Rec | RPG Full | RPG Rec | APG Full | APG Rec | 3PG Full | 3PG Rec | Trend |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|---------|----------|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| Frank Mitchell | 15.6 | 13.5 | 9.4 | 6.9 | 2.8 | 3.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | Declining scoring/boards |
| Jonah Hinton | 13.5 | 10.3 | 3.1 | 2.9 | 2.2 | 2.4 | 2.7 | 2.1 | Cooling off across the board |
| Jerome Brewer Jr. | 11.8 | 13.0 | 4.4 | 4.5 | 0.8 | 1.1 | 1.0 | 1.2 | **Rising** — playing his best ball |
| Christian Henry | 11.5 | 10.4 | 3.5 | 2.9 | 5.2 | 4.7 | 1.1 | 0.8 | Slight decline, TOs up (2.8→3.3) |
| Dasonte Bowen | 10.0 | 11.8 | 3.0 | 2.6 | 4.7 | 5.3 | 0.4 | 0.4 | **Rising** — more scoring/AST but more TOs |
| **John Hugley IV** | **10.3** | **5.2** | **4.4** | **2.9** | 1.6 | 1.1 | 0.5 | 0.2 | **Cratering** — half his season PPG |
| Alex Williams | 7.2 | 9.6 | 2.8 | 3.6 | 0.7 | 0.5 | 1.0 | 1.2 | **Rising** — earning more minutes |
| Tyrell Ward | 5.8 | 6.7 | 2.3 | 2.0 | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 0.7 | Stable/slight uptick |

**Key finding:** John Hugley IV has collapsed recently (10.3 → 5.2 PPG, z = -7.63). Full-season says drop Ward; recency says drop Hugley. Mitchell and Hinton are also trending down but remain productive.

### League-Wide Matchup Simulations

Aggregate category wins across all 7 league opponents in Period 15:

| Pool | W | L | T | vs Fordham |
|------|---|---|---|------------|
| Full season | 16 | 47 | 0 | 4-5 |
| Last 10 games | 11 | 51 | 1 | 4-5 |

Recency is **more pessimistic** overall — we drop from 16 aggregate cat wins to 11. Specific changes:

| Opponent | Full Season | Recency | Change |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Brian | 1-8 | 1-8 | — |
| Back to the Big East | 3-6 | 3-6 | Same result, flip AdjFG% for REB |
| Frank's Quality | 3-6 | **1-8** | Lost AdjFG%, AST; kept only TO |
| Linda Bruno | 2-7 | **1-8** | Lost PTS |
| Fordham | 4-5 | 4-5 | — |
| Nishy Baby | 1-8 | 1-8 | — |
| Boardwalk Hall | 2-7 | **0-8-1** | Lost REB, BLK; gained a tie |

The Fordham matchup is stable at 4-5 — our recommended strategy still holds regardless of which lens we use. The R1 plan is robust.

### Waiver Wire Targets: Recency Re-Ranking

Top 15 free agents ranked by schedule-adjusted composite z-score in Period 15:

| Rec Rank | Player | Team | Full Rank | Change | SAC Full | SAC Rec | Story |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | **Braeden Speed** | Loyola Chicago | 1 | — | 18.33 | 22.33 | **Still #1** — even better recently |
| 2 | Jacob Theodosiou | Loyola Chicago | 2 | — | 16.31 | 13.80 | Stable #2, slight dip |
| 3 | Emmett Adair | Loyola Chicago | 4 | +1 | 8.72 | 10.07 | Rising — more productive recently |
| 4 | Jordan Stiemke | Loyola Chicago | 3 | -1 | 8.95 | 8.64 | Slight slip but still elite FT%/3PT |
| 5 | David Dixon | Duquesne | 8 | +3 | 5.17 | 7.49 | Boards/blocks surging |
| 6 | Glover-Toscano | Saint Joseph's | 5 | -1 | 7.53 | 6.70 | Cooling slightly |
| 7 | Deuce Jones II | Saint Joseph's | 6 | -1 | 6.30 | 5.60 | Stable |
| 8 | **Kymany Houinsou** | **Loyola Chicago** | **22** | **+14** | 2.11 | 5.36 | **Big riser** — AST/REB surging |
| 12 | Akira Jacobs | Fordham | 21 | +9 | 2.20 | 3.65 | Hot stretch |
| 17 | Jaiun Simon | Dayton | 39 | +22 | 0.08 | 2.59 | Major riser |
| 22 | Truth Harris | La Salle | 63 | +41 | -2.37 | 1.79 | Breakout recent stretch |
| 23 | **Dion Brown** | **Saint Louis** | **7** | **-16** | **5.49** | **1.69** | **Trap alert** — full-season inflated |

**Key changes to our targets:**

- **Braeden Speed remains the undisputed #1.** His recency SAC (22.33) is even higher than full-season (18.33). No debate — he's a must-add.
- **Stiemke slips from #3 to #4** but only barely. His FT% and 3PT profile still make him the ideal second add for flipping categories vs Fordham. The recommended Speed+Stiemke combo holds.
- **Dion Brown is a trap.** Full-season ranked him #7 overall — an attractive target. Recency drops him to #23. His production has cratered recently. Avoid.
- **Kymany Houinsou is the surprise riser** (22→8). If Stiemke gets outbid, Houinsou is a viable Loyola 4-game pivot with surging AST/REB production.
- **Emmett Adair rises from #4 to #3** — trending up and now ahead of Stiemke on raw composite. But Stiemke's FT%/3PT profile remains more valuable for category-flipping vs Fordham specifically.

### Swap Simulations: Drop Candidate Shift

The recency analysis changes who we'd drop:

| Pool | Weakest Player | Composite Z |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Full season | Tyrell Ward | -3.96 |
| Last 10 games | **John Hugley IV** | **-7.63** |

Swap simulation results (aggregate W-L-T across all 7 opponents, Period 15):

| Add | Drop (Full) | Result | Drop (Rec) | Result |
|-----|-------------|--------|------------|--------|
| **Braeden Speed** | Ward | 31W-32L | **Hugley** | **37W-26L** |
| Jacob Theodosiou | Ward | 30W-33L | Hugley | 26W-36L |
| Emmett Adair | Ward | 26W-37L | Hugley | 31W-32L |
| Jordan Stiemke | Ward | 26W-36L | Hugley | 30W-33L |
| David Dixon | Ward | 22W-40L | Hugley | 21W-42L |

**+Speed -Hugley (recency) produces the best single-swap outcome in the entire analysis: 37W-26L.** That's a winning aggregate record, vs 31W-32L for the full-season drop candidate. The recency lens reveals Hugley as the bigger drag on the roster right now.

### Impact on Recommended Strategy

The core plan is **confirmed and strengthened** by recency analysis:

1. **Speed is still the #1 target** — his recency numbers are even better than his season line.
2. **The R1 matchup vs Fordham stays at 4-5 baseline** under both pools. The 7-2 projection with Speed+Stiemke should hold or improve.
3. **Drop candidate adjustment:** Consider dropping **Hugley before Ward** if only making one move. Hugley's recent collapse (z = -7.63 vs Ward's -3.96) makes him the bigger liability. For the two-player swap (our recommended plan), the order is: drop Ward+Brewer, add Speed+Stiemke — this is unchanged because we're dropping both anyway.
4. **Avoid Dion Brown** — full-season stats make him look like a top-10 FA but he's cooled off significantly. Not a target.
5. **Houinsou is the sleeper backup** if Stiemke gets outbid — Loyola 4-game schedule with rising production.

### Confidence Assessment

| Element | Confidence | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Speed as #1 add | **Very high** | #1 in both pools, recency even stronger |
| Stiemke as #2 add | **High** | Slight recency dip but FT%/3PT profile is unique |
| vs Fordham 4-5 baseline | **High** | Same result in both pools |
| 7-2 projection with Speed+Stiemke | **Medium-high** | FT% margin is thin (+.003) — recency doesn't change this |
| Drop Ward+Brewer plan | **High** | Recency reinforces Ward as expendable; Brewer is injured |
| Hugley as alternative drop | **New insight** | If making only 1 swap, drop Hugley over Ward |

## Multi-Window Robustness Analysis

The single-window recency analysis (above) compared full-season vs last-10. But how sensitive are these findings to the choice of window? We ran every key simulation across N=5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, and full season to stress-test the recommendation.

> **Reproducibility:** All results below can be reproduced by running `notebooks/recency_analysis.py` in marimo. The sensitivity, swap simulation, and swing category cells are parameterized by the Last N slider and period selector.

### Sensitivity: Baseline Matchup by Window Size

Before any roster moves, how does the Fordham matchup change as we vary N?

| Window | vs Fordham | Agg W-L-T (all opps) | Beat Fordham? |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|---------------|
| N=5 | 6-2-1 | 26-35-2 | **YES** |
| N=7 | 6-3 | 19-44 | **YES** |
| N=10 | 4-5 | 11-51-1 | no |
| N=15 | 5-4 | 19-44 | **YES** |
| N=20 | 4-5 | 20-43 | no |
| N=25 | 4-5 | 14-46-3 | no |
| Full | 4-5 | 16-47 | no |

**Observations:**
- Short windows (N=5-7) are the most optimistic — they capture recent hot streaks (Bowen, Williams rising) and discount cold stretches (Hugley, Hinton declining).
- N=10 is paradoxically the **most pessimistic** window (11 agg wins), worse than even full season (16). This is because it captures Hugley's collapse and Hinton's cooling without the stabilizing effect of their earlier strong play.
- N=15 hits the sweet spot: enough data for stability, recent enough to flip Fordham to a win (5-4).
- N=20+ converges to full-season and the Fordham matchup reverts to 4-5.
- **The baseline Fordham result is fragile** — it flips between win and loss depending on the window. This reinforces why we need roster moves, not just a prayer.

### Swap Simulations Across All Windows

The critical question: does Speed+Stiemke hold up no matter which player pool we use?

#### Speed only (drop Ward)

| Pool | vs Fordham | Agg W-L-T | Beat Fordham? |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| N=5 | 7-2 | 33-29-1 | **YES** |
| N=7 | 5-4 | 35-28 | **YES** |
| N=10 | 5-4 | 32-31 | **YES** |
| N=15 | 7-2 | 39-24 | **YES** |
| Full | 4-5 | 31-32 | no |

Speed alone beats Fordham under every recency window but **fails under full-season**. This is the key risk of a single swap — it's not robust to the choice of projection method.

#### Speed+Stiemke (drop Ward+Brewer) — RECOMMENDED

| Pool | vs Fordham | Agg W-L-T | Beat Fordham? |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| N=5 | 7-1-1 | 44-18-1 | **YES** |
| N=7 | **8-1** | 42-21 | **YES** |
| N=10 | 7-2 | 39-22-2 | **YES** |
| N=15 | 7-2 | 42-21 | **YES** |
| Full | 7-2 | 38-24-1 | **YES** |

**This is the strongest result in the entire analysis.** 7-2 or better vs Fordham at every single window. The aggregate record is a commanding win everywhere (38+ cat wins, never below .600). Stiemke's addition provides the robustness that Speed alone lacks.

#### Speed+Stiemke (drop Hugley+Brewer) — ALTERNATIVE

| Pool | vs Fordham | Agg W-L-T | Beat Fordham? |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| N=5 | **8-1** | **47-15-1** | **YES** |
| N=7 | **8-1** | 44-19 | **YES** |
| N=10 | 7-2 | 41-22 | **YES** |
| N=15 | 7-2 | 43-19-1 | **YES** |
| Full | 6-3 | 38-25 | **YES** |

Dropping Hugley instead of Ward produces **even better results** at short windows (8-1 at N=5 and N=7, 47-15 aggregate at N=5). This aligns with the recency finding that Hugley's recent collapse makes him a bigger drag than Ward. The full-season result dips slightly to 6-3 vs Fordham (still a comfortable win) because Ward's full-season line is weaker than Hugley's.

### Swing Category Deep Dive (Speed+Stiemke, drop Ward+Brewer)

The categories that flip from loss to win are FT%, 3PTM, and BLK. How stable are these margins across windows?

#### FT% — The Tightest Swing Category

| Pool | Us | Them | Margin | Win? |
|------|------|------|--------|------|
| N=5 | .761 | .750 | **+.011** | W |
| N=7 | .765 | .728 | **+.037** | W |
| N=10 | .750 | .731 | **+.019** | W |
| N=15 | .774 | .738 | **+.036** | W |
| Full | .770 | .767 | +.003 | W |

FT% is a win at every window. The full-season margin (+.003) is razor-thin, but recency actually makes it **safer** — Fordham's FT% drops more than ours under recency because their weaker players (Moore, Crawford) drag down their percentage more in smaller samples. N=7 and N=15 give the most comfortable FT% margins (+.037 and +.036).

#### 3PTM

| Pool | Us | Them | Margin | Win? |
|------|------|------|--------|------|
| N=5 | 22.4 | 22.4 | +0.0 | **TIE** |
| N=7 | 23.4 | 22.4 | +1.0 | W |
| N=10 | 24.2 | 21.9 | +2.3 | W |
| N=15 | 26.6 | 20.1 | +6.5 | W |
| Full | 24.6 | 20.8 | +3.8 | W |

Win everywhere except N=5 where it's an exact tie. The N=5 tie is driven by Stiemke's 3PT production being slightly lower in his most recent 5 games (2.0/g) vs his season average (1.7/g) — the opponent also adjusts. N=15 gives the widest margin (+6.5).

#### BLK

| Pool | Us | Them | Margin | Win? |
|------|------|------|--------|------|
| N=5 | 6.8 | 3.2 | +3.6 | W |
| N=7 | 5.2 | 3.2 | +2.0 | W |
| N=10 | 4.4 | 4.1 | +0.3 | W |
| N=15 | 5.8 | 4.3 | +1.5 | W |
| Full | 5.0 | 4.2 | +0.8 | W |

Comfortable win across all windows. Even the tightest margin (N=10, +0.3) is a win.

#### AdjFG% (punt category)

| Pool | Us | Them | Margin | Win? |
|------|------|------|--------|------|
| N=5 | .548 | .518 | +.030 | W |
| N=7 | .530 | .528 | +.002 | W |
| N=10 | .506 | .545 | -.039 | L |
| N=15 | .510 | .516 | -.007 | L |
| Full | .505 | .531 | -.026 | L |

Interesting: we actually **win** AdjFG% at N=5 and N=7, pushing the total to 8-1 or 9-0 at those windows. At longer windows it reverts to a punt loss. This doesn't change strategy — we don't need it — but it's a bonus if recent shooting trends hold.

### Speed & Stiemke: Individual Stat Reliability

Are the add targets performing consistently, or are we chasing a hot streak?

| Window | Player | PPG | RPG | APG | 3PG | FT% | AdjFG% |
|--------|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| N=5 | Braeden Speed | 17.4 | 5.0 | 4.2 | 1.6 | .714 | .537 |
| N=7 | Braeden Speed | 18.7 | 4.6 | 3.7 | 2.0 | .794 | .553 |
| N=10 | Braeden Speed | 17.6 | 5.0 | 3.4 | 2.3 | .780 | .539 |
| N=15 | Braeden Speed | 17.3 | 4.9 | 3.7 | 2.0 | .809 | .536 |
| Full | Braeden Speed | 15.1 | 4.5 | 3.4 | 1.6 | .824 | .523 |
| N=5 | Jordan Stiemke | 12.8 | 2.6 | 1.6 | 2.0 | .800 | .622 |
| N=7 | Jordan Stiemke | 10.6 | 2.9 | 1.3 | 1.6 | .786 | .573 |
| N=10 | Jordan Stiemke | 9.3 | 3.0 | 1.4 | 1.4 | .833 | .534 |
| N=15 | Jordan Stiemke | 8.7 | 3.3 | 1.5 | 1.5 | .864 | .467 |
| Full | Jordan Stiemke | 9.5 | 3.1 | 1.4 | 1.7 | .868 | .493 |

**Speed** is performing *above* his season line across every recent window (15.1 PPG full → 17-19 PPG recent). He's peaking at the right time. His FT% dips at N=5 (.714) but is strong at N=7+ (.780-.824). Not a hot-streak artifact — the elevation is sustained across 15+ games.

**Stiemke** has elite FT% (.786-.868) at every window. His scoring and 3PT fluctuate slightly but his category-flipping profile (FT% + 3PT) is consistent. His full-season FT% (.868) is actually his best — recency doesn't inflate it, it's a legitimate skill.

## Full Roster Optimization

With **unlimited drops and adds**, the right question is: what is the optimal roster configuration? We ran a systematic search across **all combinations of 0-8 drops** from the current roster, filling each vacancy from the top 15 free agents by GP-weighted production, with the 15 GP cap enforced.

### Critical Constraint: 15 GP Cap

The 15 GP maximum changes everything. With Loyola adds (4G each), someone gets benched. The earlier 2-move analysis projected category totals *without enforcing the GP cap*. When we enforce it properly — benching lowest-value players first — the results shift significantly.

### GP-Managed Results: Old 2-Move Plan (Drop Ward+Brewer, Add Speed+Stiemke)

With GP management, Stiemke only gets 1 starting game under full-season projections because Henry/Hugley/Williams eat up GP:

| Pool | vs Fordham | FT% Margin | GP: Stiemke starts |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| N=5 | 7-2 | +.016 | 4G |
| N=7 | 7-2 | +.037 | 4G |
| N=10 | 5-4 | +.026 | 1G |
| N=15 | 6-3 | +.038 | 2G |
| Full | **4-5** | **-.009** | **1G** |

Under full-season projections, **the old plan actually loses** because the GP cap forces Stiemke to the bench and Henry's terrible FT% (.606) drags us down.

### The Real Problem: Christian Henry

Henry eats 2 GP with: FT% .606 (worst on roster), AdjFG% .437 (worst on roster), TO/G 2.8 (worst on roster). He contributes AST and ST but actively hurts us in every swing category. **Every winning scenario in the systematic search drops Henry.**

### Systematic Search: Best Result at Each Move Count (0-8 Drops)

| Moves | vs Fordham | Agg W-L-T | Drops | Adds |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|------|
| 0 | 4-5 | 13-50 | — | — |
| 1 | 5-4 | 30-33 | Henry | Speed |
| 2 | 7-2 | 32-31 | Henry, Hinton | Speed, Stiemke |
| 3 | **8-1** | 32-30-1 | Henry, Hugley, Ward | Speed, Glover-Toscano, Brown |
| **4** | **9-0** | **33-30** | **Henry, Hugley, Mitchell, Williams** | **Speed, Glover-Toscano, Sirtautas, Brown** |
| 5 | 9-0 | 33-30 | Henry, Hugley, Mitchell, Ward, Williams | Speed, Glover-Toscano, Sirtautas, Houinsou, Brown |
| 6 | 8-1 | 34-29 | Bowen, Henry, Hinton, Hugley, Mitchell, Ward | Speed, Stiemke, Glover-Toscano, Love, Sirtautas, Brown |
| 7 | 8-1 | 34-29 | *(drops 7 of 8)* | Speed, Stiemke, Glover-Toscano, Love, Sirtautas, Houinsou, Brown |
| 8 | 8-1 | 31-32 | *(full rebuild)* | Speed, Stiemke, Glover-Toscano, Love, Sirtautas, Houinsou, Brown, Tracey |

**A 9-0 sweep is possible at 4 drops.** But the full rebuild (8 drops) is *worse* than targeted moves — dropping everyone loses core talent faster than the FA pool can replace it.

### The 9-0 Sweep Scenario (4 Drops)

Drop Henry, Hugley, Mitchell, Williams. Add Speed, Glover-Toscano, Sirtautas, Dion Brown.

| Category | Us | Them | Margin | Result |
|----------|------|------|--------|--------|
| AdjFG% | .534 | .531 | +.002 | **WIN** |
| 3PTM | 21.5 | 20.8 | +0.7 | **WIN** |
| FT% | .785 | .767 | +.018 | **WIN** |
| PTS | 190.3 | 162.2 | +28.1 | **WIN** |
| REB | 62.8 | 47.4 | +15.4 | **WIN** |
| AST | 35.6 | 33.0 | +2.6 | **WIN** |
| ST | 12.5 | 11.8 | +0.7 | **WIN** |
| BLK | 5.2 | 4.2 | +1.0 | **WIN** |
| TO | 25.7 | 26.9 | -1.2 | **WIN** |

Wins every category. Even AdjFG% flips to a win (+.002) because removing Mitchell's low-volume games and Henry's .437 AdjFG% improves the team's volume-weighted shooting.

**Caution:** This plan relies on **Dion Brown**, who we identified earlier as a recency trap (full-season rank #7 → recency rank #23, production cratering). It also **drops Frank Mitchell**, our best full-season player. High ceiling, but higher risk.

### The 3-Drop Stiemke Plan (Conservative)

Drop Henry, Hugley, Brewer. Add Speed, Stiemke, Chuck Love III.

| Pool | vs Fordham | Agg W-L-T | FT% Margin | 3PTM Margin |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| N=5 | **8-1** | 40-23 | +.017 | -3.6 |
| N=7 | **8-1** | 40-22-1 | +.040 | -1.6 |
| N=10 | 6-3 | 33-30 | +.045 | -1.1 |
| N=15 | **8-1** | 36-27 | +.059 | +1.6 |
| Full | **8-1** | 32-31 | +.035 | +0.1 |

8-1 at four out of five windows. FT% margin is wide (+.017 to +.059).

### Why GP Efficiency Matters

**Old 2-move roster (15 GP):**
- Speed 4G + Stiemke 1G + Mitchell 2G + Hinton 2G + Bowen 2G + Henry 2G + Hugley 2G = 15
- Henry's 2 bad-FT% games are in the lineup. Stiemke only gets 1 game.

**3-move Stiemke roster (15 GP):**
- Speed 4G + Stiemke 4G + Love 1G + Mitchell 2G + Hinton 2G + Bowen 2G = 15
- No bad-FT% players. Stiemke gets full value from his 4-game schedule.

**4-move sweep roster (15 GP):**
- Speed 4G + Bowen 2G + Hinton 2G + Brewer 2G + Glover-Toscano 2G + Brown 2G + Sirtautas 1G = 15
- Maximum roster diversity. Sirtautas brings BLK (1.8/G). Brown and Glover-Toscano are high-PPG.

## Opponent Modeling: Fordham's Counter-Moves

Fordham's current GP: **15** (exactly at cap — no benching needed). But what if they also make waiver moves?

### Fordham's Roster

| Player | Team | P15 Games | PPG | Drop Candidate? |
|--------|------|-----------|-----|-----------------|
| Justin Moore | Loyola Chicago | 4 | 11.4 | No — 4G schedule |
| Trey Green | Saint Louis | 2 | 12.1 | No — elite player |
| Amael L'Etang | Dayton | 2 | 11.2 | No — BLK anchor (1.2/G) |
| Myles Corey | Rhode Island | 2 | 9.9 | Possible |
| Cameron Crawford | Duquesne | 2 | 5.6 | **Yes — weakest 2G player** |
| Kory Mincy | George Mason | 1 | 15.2 | No — elite but only 1G |
| Garrett Johnson | George Washington | 1 | 13.0 | Possible — only 1G |
| Fatt Hill | George Mason | 1 | 10.8 | **Yes — weakest 1G player** |

Their most likely move: drop Crawford (5.6 PPG, 2G) for a Loyola FA. Available to them: Theodosiou (14.1 PPG, 4G), Adair (13.6 PPG, 4G), Stiemke (9.5 PPG, 4G), etc.

### Results Matrix: Our Plan vs Fordham's Counter

| Our Plan | Fordham baseline | +Theodosiou | +Adair | +Theo+Adair |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 3-drop Stiemke | **8-1** | **4-5** (loss!) | TBD | **5-4** |
| 4-drop sweep | **9-0** | **6-3** | TBD | **5-4** |

**Critical finding:** If Fordham adds Theodosiou, our 3-drop Stiemke plan **drops from 8-1 to 4-5** — a loss. The 4-drop sweep plan stays at **6-3** — still a comfortable win. In the worst case (Fordham adds Theo+Adair, dropping Crawford+Hill), both plans converge to **5-4** — a narrow win.

**The 4-drop plan is more resilient to Fordham's counter-moves.** This is because it diversifies across more FA targets (Glover-Toscano, Sirtautas, Brown) rather than concentrating on Stiemke/Love who are more Loyola-dependent.

---

## Final Recommendation

### How We Got Here

1. **Baseline matchup analysis** (full-season) → 4-5 vs Fordham, winning PTS/REB/AST/ST
2. **Initial swap simulations** (2 moves) → identified Speed+Stiemke as the category-flipping combo
3. **Single-window recency analysis** (N=10) → confirmed baseline, surfaced Hugley's collapse
4. **Multi-window robustness analysis** (N=5 through N=25) → confirmed swap recommendation holds across all windows
5. **GP-constrained optimization** → revealed the 2-move plan was overstated; Henry is the real problem
6. **Full-spectrum search (0-8 drops)** → discovered a 9-0 sweep at 4 drops; confirmed 8 drops (full rebuild) is worse than targeted moves
7. **Opponent modeling** → Fordham counter-moves break the 3-drop plan but the 4-drop plan is resilient

### Two Plans

#### Plan A: 3-Drop Stiemke (Conservative, 8-1)

| Priority | Drop | Add | Bid |
|----------|------|-----|-----|
| **1** | Christian Henry | Braeden Speed | $50 |
| **2** | Jerome Brewer Jr. | Jordan Stiemke | $25-30 |
| **3** | John Hugley IV | Chuck Love III | $5-10 |

**Budget:** $90. **Result:** 8-1 vs Fordham (baseline). **Risk:** Drops to 4-5 if Fordham adds Theodosiou.

#### Plan B: 4-Drop Sweep (Aggressive, 9-0)

| Priority | Drop | Add | Bid |
|----------|------|-----|-----|
| **1** | Christian Henry | Braeden Speed | $50 |
| **2** | John Hugley IV | Jaiden Glover-Toscano | $15-20 |
| **3** | Frank Mitchell | Jonas Sirtautas | $5 |
| **4** | Alex Williams | Dion Brown | $5-10 |

**Budget:** $80. **Result:** 9-0 sweep (baseline). **Risk:** Drops Mitchell (best player), relies on Dion Brown (recency trap). Still 6-3 if Fordham counters with Theodosiou.

### Decision Framework

| Factor | Plan A (3-drop) | Plan B (4-drop) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Ceiling | 8-1 | **9-0** |
| Floor (Fordham counters) | 4-5 (loss) | **5-4 (still wins)** |
| Relies on Brown (trap)? | No | **Yes** |
| Drops Mitchell? | No | **Yes** |
| Budget remaining | $10 | $20 |
| Recency robustness | 8-1 at 4/5 windows | Not yet tested across windows |

**Recommendation:**
- **If you believe Fordham won't counter-move** → Plan A is safer (8-1 with wide margins)
- **If you think Fordham will add Loyola players** → Plan B is more resilient (6-3 vs counter)
- **Hedge:** Execute Plan A but consider Glover-Toscano as an additional low-cost add if budget allows. The 3PTM and AdjFG% flipping from the sweep plan can be partially captured by adding high-3PT FAs.

### Post-Swap Roster & GP Allocation (Plan A)

| Player | Team | P15 Games | Start | Notes |
|--------|------|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Braeden Speed** | Loyola Chicago | 4 | **4G** | Must-start all 4. Best player post-swap. |
| **Jordan Stiemke** | Loyola Chicago | 4 | **4G** | Must-start all 4. FT% and 3PT anchor. |
| **Chuck Love III** | Loyola Chicago | 4 | **1G** | Start 1, bench 3. Low-cost GP filler. |
| Frank Mitchell | St. Bonaventure | 2 | **2G** | Core keeper. Best rebounder. |
| Jonah Hinton | Rhode Island | 2 | **2G** | Core keeper. 3PT specialist. |
| Dasonte Bowen | St. Bonaventure | 2 | **2G** | Core keeper. AST anchor. |
| Tyrell Ward | VCU | 2 | **0G** | Bench insurance. |
| Alex Williams | Duquesne | 2 | **0G** | Bench insurance. |

**Total: 15 GP** (exactly at cap).

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Outbid on Speed | Low | High | Bid $50. No substitute at his level. |
| Outbid on Stiemke (Plan A) | Medium | Medium | Pivot to Adair or Houinsou (Loyola 4G). |
| Fordham adds Theodosiou | Medium | **High for Plan A** | Consider Plan B or hedge with additional add. |
| Fordham adds Theo+Adair | Low | Medium | Both plans project 5-4 — still a win. |
| Dion Brown underperforms (Plan B) | High | Medium | His production has cratered recently. Consider a different 2G FA if going Plan B. |
| 3PTM margin is tight (Plan A) | Medium | Low | +0.1 full-season. Even if it flips, we win 7-2. |

### Confidence Summary

| Element | Confidence | Evidence |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Drop Henry first | **Very high** | Every winning scenario drops him. No exceptions in 0-8 search. |
| Speed as #1 add | **Very high** | #1 across every pool and window. Peaking recently. |
| 3-drop plan (8-1) | **High** | 8-1 at 4/5 recency windows. But fragile to Fordham counter. |
| 4-drop plan (9-0) | **Medium-high** | Highest ceiling. More resilient to counters. But relies on Dion Brown. |
| Full rebuild is bad | **Very high** | 8 drops produces 8-1 / 31-32 agg — worse than 3 or 4 targeted drops. |
| Fordham will counter | **Medium** | They have budget and Crawford is an obvious drop. But they may not prioritize Loyola FAs. |

## Tournament Arc Analysis (P15 → P16 → P17)

### Why This Matters

Winning R1 is necessary but not sufficient — we need a roster that stays competitive through the full playoff. The Loyola schedule edge that powers our R1 strategy **fades each round**:

| Period | Loyola Games | Most Teams | Edge |
|--------|-------------|------------|------|
| **P15 (R1)** | **4G** | 2G | **+2G** |
| P16 (R2) | 3G | 2G | +1G |
| P17 (R3) | 2G | 2G | None |

### Schedule Implications

By P17, Loyola players are just regular 2G contributors — no schedule edge at all. This means any roster move that sacrifices strong full-season talent for Loyola depth will hurt in later rounds.

### Plans Under Consideration

| Plan | Moves | Cost | Budget Left |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| **A** (3-drop Stiemke) | Drop Henry/Hugley/Brewer, Add Speed/Stiemke/Love | $90 | **$10** |
| **B** (4-drop +Brown) | Drop Henry/Hugley/Mitchell/Williams, Add Speed/Glover-Toscano/Sirtautas/Brown | $75 | **$25** |
| **C** (4-drop +Tracey) | Drop Henry/Hugley/Mitchell/Williams, Add Speed/Glover-Toscano/Sirtautas/Tracey | $75 | **$25** |
| **D** (4-drop +Daughtry) | Same drops as C, Add .../Daughtry instead of Tracey | $75 | **$25** |

Plans B/C/D replace Dion Brown (recency trap) with stable 2G alternatives. Plan C uses Jadrian Tracey (VCU 2G), Plan D uses Kelton Daughtry (Richmond 2G).

### Recency Stress Test (P15 vs Fordham)

| Plan | Full | N=5 | N=7 | N=10 | N=15 | Floor |
|------|------|-----|-----|------|------|-------|
| **A** | 8-1 | 8-1 | 8-1 | 6-3 | 8-1 | **6-3** |
| **B** | 9-0 | 7-2 | 8-1 | 7-2 | 8-1 | **7-2** |
| **C** | 8-1 | 8-1 | **9-0** | 7-2 | 8-1 | **7-2** |
| **D** | 8-1 | 8-1 | 8-1 | 7-2 | 8-1 | **7-2** |

All plans comfortably beat Fordham across every recency window. Plan C (Tracey) notably hits **9-0 at N=7** without Brown's recency risk.

### Multi-Period Projections (Full-Season)

| Plan | P15 vs Fordham | P16 vs Nishy | P16 vs BigEast | P17 vs Nishy |
|------|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **A** (3-drop) | **8-1** | 5-4 | 4-5 | 3-6 |
| **B** (4-drop Brown) | **9-0** | 6-3 | 4-5 | 3-6 |
| **C** (4-drop Tracey) | **8-1** | **6-3** | 4-5 | 3-6 |
| **D** (4-drop Daughtry) | **8-1** | 5-4 | 4-5 | 3-6 |

Key findings:
- **Plan A projects weaker in P16** (5-4 vs Nishy) despite preserving Mitchell — the 4th add (Love vs Sirtautas) matters more than Mitchell at reduced Loyola games
- **Plans B and C both project 6-3 in P16** — the extra roster flexibility from 4 drops actually helps later rounds
- **P17 is a wash** — all plans project 3-6 vs Nishy when Loyola drops to 2G. R3 will require additional moves regardless.

### Budget Considerations

| Plan | P15 Spend | Remaining | R2 Flexibility |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **A** | $90 | $10 | Minimal — can only grab $5-10 FAs |
| **C** | $75 | $25 | Moderate — can make 1-2 targeted adds |

Plan A's budget crunch is a real liability. If we advance to R2 and need to adjust for the BigEast matchup, $10 buys almost nothing. Plan C's $25 reserve allows meaningful R2 adaptation.

### Updated Recommendation

**Plan C (4-drop +Tracey) is the optimal strategy across the full tournament:**

| Factor | Plan A (3-drop) | Plan C (4-drop Tracey) |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|
| P15 vs Fordham | 8-1 | 8-1 (9-0 at N=7) |
| Fordham counters | Fragile (drops to 4-5) | Resilient (stays 6-3) |
| P16 vs Nishy | 5-4 | **6-3** |
| Budget remaining | $10 | **$25** |
| Recency floor | 6-3 | **7-2** |
| Brown dependency | N/A | **None** (Tracey is stable) |

**Action items:**
1. Drop: Christian Henry, John Hugley IV, Frank Mitchell, Alex Williams
2. Add: Braeden Speed ($50), Jaiden Glover-Toscano ($15), Jonas Sirtautas ($5), Jadrian Tracey ($5)
3. Reserve $25 for R2 adjustments

### Risk Assessment (Updated)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Outbid on Speed | Low | High | Bid $50. No substitute. |
| Fordham adds Theodosiou | Medium | **Low for Plan C** | Plan C stays 6-3 even with counter |
| P17 looks bad for everyone | High | Medium | $25 reserve allows R3 pivots |
| Tracey underperforms | Low | Low | VCU 2G, stable production |
| Need R2 moves but no budget (Plan A) | Medium | High | **This is why Plan C is better** |

## STANDINGS CORRECTION & OPPONENT SWITCH

### What Changed

All analysis above (Fordham scouting, swap sims, opponent modeling, tournament arc) was built on the assumption that Fordham was our R1 opponent. This was based on:

1. **Points-based standings** from our data (through P13) — incorrect tiebreaker
2. **Fantrax uses category win percentage**, not points, for seedings

With P14 in progress (ending Feb 15), Boardwalk Hall (.453 → projected .437) overtakes Fordham (.453 → projected .421) for the #5 seed. **Our R1 opponent is Boardwalk Hall, not Fordham.**

### Why This Matters

Boardwalk Hall is a **fundamentally different matchup**. They are strong in categories where Fordham was weak:

| Category | Boardwalk | Fordham | Implication |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| AST | **42.0** | 33.0 | BW much stronger |
| ST | **17.0** | 11.8 | BW much stronger |
| TO | **22.8** (low) | 26.9 | BW much cleaner |
| 3PTM | **21.2** | 20.8 | BW slightly better |
| AdjFG% | **.538** | .531 | BW slightly better |

The Fordham-optimized plans (heavy Loyola loading, punt AST/ST/TO) **lose to Boardwalk 4-5** because they trade away the AST production needed to beat Boardwalk's 42.0.

### Boardwalk Hall Roster

| Player | Team | P15 Games | PPG | RPG | APG | SPG | FT% |
|--------|------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Tarence Guinyard | Duquesne | 2 | 16.2 | 3.3 | 5.2 | 1.2 | .700 |
| Robbie Avila | Saint Louis | 2 | 12.4 | 4.4 | 4.4 | 0.7 | .775 |
| Jaeden Marshall | La Salle | 2 | 12.4 | 2.2 | 1.3 | 0.3 | .880 |

| Nyk Lewis | VCU | 2 | 8.5 | 4.0 | 1.9 | 1.2 | .765 |
| Ashton Walker | La Salle | 2 | 7.4 | 3.4 | 3.3 | 1.0 | .619 |

**GP: 16 total (cap 15)** — they bench their weakest player for 1 game. All players are 2G, no schedule edge. They have **no Loyola players** and diverse team coverage.

**Their strengths:** AST (Guinyard 5.2 + Avila 4.4 + Walker 3.3), ST (Friedrichsen 1.4 + Schulte 1.4 + Argabright 1.3), clean TO, high 3PTM (Marshall + Friedrichsen + Guinyard all shoot 3s), decent FT% (.757 team).

**Their weakness:** BLK (1.8 total — almost nobody blocks), middling REB outside Schulte.

## Re-Analysis: vs Boardwalk Hall

### Baseline: 2-7 (we lose badly)

Without any moves, we win only REB and BLK. We lose everything else.

### Systematic Drop Search vs Boardwalk

| Drops | Best Result vs BW | Agg W-L-T | Optimal Moves |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|
| 0 | 2-7 | 13-50 | (no moves) |
| **1** | **5-4** | **28-35** | **Drop Hugley, Add Speed** |
| 2 | 5-4 | 29-34 | Drop Bowen+Hinton, Add Speed+Theodosiou |
| 3 | 5-4 | 28-35 | Drop Bowen+Henry+Mitchell, Add Speed+Theo+Adair |
| 4 | 5-4 | 28-35 | Various combos |
| 5-7 | 5-4 | 28-35 | Various combos |
| 8 | 3-6 | 23-40 | Full rebuild (worse!) |

**Critical finding: 5-4 is the ceiling regardless of how many moves we make.** More drops don't improve the Boardwalk matchup — we max out at 5-4 with just 1 move.

### The Winning 1-Drop: Hugley → Speed

| Category | Us | Boardwalk | Gap | Result |
|----------|-----|-----------|-----|--------|
| PTS | 192.4 | 177.6 | +14.8 | **WIN** |
| REB | 67.6 | 61.8 | +5.8 | **WIN** |
| AST | 45.7 | 42.0 | +3.7 | **WIN** |
| BLK | 3.4 | 1.8 | +1.6 | **WIN** |
| FT% | .762 | .757 | +.005 | **WIN** |
| AdjFG% | .508 | .538 | -.030 | LOSS |
| 3PTM | 17.8 | 21.2 | -3.4 | LOSS |
| ST | 14.6 | 17.0 | -2.4 | LOSS |
| TO | 29.3 | 22.8 | -6.5 | LOSS |

**Result: 5-4 WIN.** We take PTS, REB, AST, BLK, FT% and concede AdjFG%, 3PTM, ST, TO.

Why this works:
- **Preserves our AST core** (Henry 5.2 + Bowen 4.7 + Mitchell 2.8 + Hinton 2.2 = enough to beat 42.0)
- **Speed's 4G at Loyola** pushes PTS/REB/BLK over the top
- **FT% flips** because Speed (.824) replaces Hugley (.734) — a net positive on the tightest category
- Dropping Hugley is free value — he's cratering (z = -7.63 recently)

### GP Allocation (1-Drop Plan)

| Player | Team | Games |
|--------|------|-------|
| Braeden Speed | Loyola Chicago | 4G |
| Dasonte Bowen | St. Bonaventure | 2G |
| Christian Henry | Fordham | 2G |
| Jonah Hinton | Rhode Island | 2G |
| Frank Mitchell | St. Bonaventure | 2G |
| Jerome Brewer Jr. | La Salle | 2G |
| Alex Williams | Duquesne | 1G |
| Tyrell Ward | VCU | 0G |

**Total: 15 GP** (exactly at cap). Ward benched entirely, Williams gets 1G.

### Recency Stress Test vs Boardwalk

| Window | 1-Drop (Hugley→Speed) |
|--------|----------------------|
| Full season | **5-4 WIN** |
| N=5 | **6-3 WIN** |
| N=7 | 4-5 loss |
| N=10 | **6-3 WIN** |
| N=15 | **5-4 WIN** |

**Floor: 4-5 at N=7.** This is the one vulnerable window — we need to understand what flips there. At most windows we win comfortably (5-4 or 6-3).

### Fordham-Optimized Plans vs Boardwalk (why they fail)

| Plan | vs Boardwalk | vs Fordham | Problem |
|------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Plan A (3-drop Stiemke) | **4-5 LOSS** | 8-1 | Loses AST (39.6 < 42.0) by dropping Henry |
| Plan C (4-drop Tracey) | **4-5 LOSS** | 8-1 | Loses AST (35.8 < 42.0) by dropping Mitchell+Henry |
| Plan B (4-drop Brown) | 5-4 win | 9-0 | Only works because Brown's AdjFG% compensates, but Brown is a recency trap |

The multi-drop plans optimized for Fordham all trade away AST production (Henry, Bowen, Mitchell) for Loyola volume. Against Boardwalk's elite AST (42.0), that's the wrong trade.

### League-Wide Gut Check

| Plan | Agg W-L-T | Assessment |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Baseline (no moves) | 13-50-0 | Terrible |
| **1-drop (Hugley→Speed)** | **28-35-0** | Best single-move improvement (+15 wins) |
| Plan A (3-drop) | 32-31-0 | Better aggregate but loses R1 matchup |
| Plan C (4-drop) | 30-33-0 | Negative aggregate AND loses R1 matchup |

The 1-drop is the only plan that both beats Boardwalk AND doesn't destroy our league-wide competitiveness. The Fordham-optimized multi-drop plans have better aggregate records but **lose the actual matchup that matters**.

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION (Updated)

### The Move: Drop John Hugley IV, Add Braeden Speed

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Drop** | John Hugley IV (Duquesne, cratering z=-7.63) |
| **Add** | Braeden Speed (Loyola Chicago, 4G, z=+5.02) |
| **Bid** | $50 |
| **Budget remaining** | $50 for R2/R3 |
| **Projected R1 result** | 5-4 WIN vs Boardwalk |

### Why Only 1 Move?

1. **5-4 is the ceiling** — more moves don't improve the Boardwalk matchup
2. **Preserves roster flexibility** — we keep 7 of 8 original players for R2 adaptation
3. **Preserves budget** — $50 remaining vs $10-25 under multi-drop plans
4. **Preserves AST core** — Henry (5.2) + Bowen (4.7) + Mitchell (2.8) are essential to beating Boardwalk's 42.0 AST
5. **R2 moves are still available** — we can make additional drops/adds after R1 if we advance, tailored to whoever we face

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Outbid on Speed | Low | High | Bid $50. No substitute at his level. |
| Brewer can't play (DTD) | Medium | Medium | If Brewer is out, we drop to 13 GP — need a replacement add. Consider Stiemke or Adair as 2nd move if Brewer is ruled out. |
| N=7 window loss (4-5) | Low | Medium | 4 of 5 windows project a win. N=7 is an outlier. |
| Boardwalk counter-moves | Low | Low | They have no Loyola players and limited FA options. Their roster is already well-constructed. |
| FT% margin is thin (+.005) | Medium | High | This is the swing cat. One bad FT night could flip it. Speed's .824 FT% helps but Henry's .606 hurts. |

### Contingency: If Brewer Is Ruled Out

If Brewer can't play, we lose 2 GP of production and need a replacement. Best options:
- **Add Jordan Stiemke** (Loyola 4G, elite FT%) — drop Brewer, bid $15-25
- **Add Emmett Adair** (Loyola 4G, PTS/REB) — drop Brewer, bid $10-15
- This turns into a 2-move plan (Hugley→Speed + Brewer→Stiemke/Adair) and preserves the AST core

### Confidence Summary

| Element | Confidence | Evidence |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Boardwalk is R1 opponent | **High** | Live standings + P14 scores make it near-certain |
| Speed as #1 add | **Very high** | #1 across every pool and window |
| Drop Hugley | **Very high** | Cratering (z=-7.63), worst on roster recently |
| 5-4 projection vs Boardwalk | **Medium-high** | Wins at 4 of 5 recency windows. FT% is tight. |
| 1 move is sufficient | **High** | Systematic search confirms 5-4 ceiling at any drop count |
| Multi-drop plans hurt us | **High** | Plans A/C lose to Boardwalk 4-5 by sacrificing AST |

### Analytical Journey

This analysis went through several phases, each documented above:

1. **Initial analysis** assumed Fordham as opponent, recommended Speed+Stiemke (7-2 projected)
2. **GP cap enforcement** revealed the 2-move plan was weaker than thought, led to 3-drop plan (8-1)
3. **Full roster optimization** found 4-drop plan for 9-0 sweep vs Fordham
4. **Opponent modeling** stress-tested against Fordham counter-moves
5. **Tournament arc** evaluated multi-round implications and budget
6. **STANDINGS CORRECTION** discovered Boardwalk is actually #5, not Fordham
7. **Re-analysis vs Boardwalk** revealed the Fordham-optimized plans lose, and 1 move is optimal

The entire Fordham analysis (sections above) is preserved for two reasons: (a) reproducibility of the analytical process, and (b) Fordham analysis remains relevant if standings shift before P14 ends.

### Reproducibility

All projections, simulations, and opponent modeling can be reproduced interactively:

```

```

The notebook contains:
- **Sensitivity analysis** — baseline matchup across N=5 to N=25
- **GP-managed swap simulations** — all swap plans with 15 GP cap enforced
- **Swing category deep dive** — FT%/3PTM/BLK/TO/AdjFG% margins
- **Full roster optimization** — systematic search across 0-8 drops
- **Opponent modeling** — Fordham counter-move matrix
- **Tournament arc analysis** — multi-period projections, recency stress test, budget analysis
- **Boardwalk analysis** — corrected R1 opponent scouting, category breakdown, 1-drop recommendation
