## Tuesday Results (Day 1 Complete)

3 of our players played (Brown, Tracey, Hinton) vs 2 of theirs (Avila, Lewis).

### Live Scoreboard: 5-4 US

| Category | Us | Them | Result |
|----------|---:|-----:|--------|
| AdjFG% | .776 | .632 | **WIN** |
| 3PTM | 9 | 6 | **WIN** |
| FT% | .600 | .846 | LOSE |
| PTS | 48 | 35 | **WIN** |
| REB | 8 | 11 | LOSE |
| AST | 3 | 4 | LOSE |
| ST | 5 | 4 | **WIN** |
| BLK | 1 | 0 | **WIN** |
| TO | 4 | 1 | LOSE |

Day 1 category mix differs from projection (winning 3PTM + ST instead of FT% + REB). One-day samples are volatile — expect regression toward projections as more games are played.

## Full-Week Projection: 5-4 WIN

| Category | Us (proj) | Them (proj) | Margin | Risk |
|----------|----------:|------------:|-------:|------|
| **REB** | 73.8 | 62.6 | +11.2 | Safe |
| **BLK** | 7.6 | 1.8 | +5.8 | Lock |
| **PTS** | 183.8 | 180.2 | +3.6 | Moderate |
| **AdjFG%** | 55.1% | 53.9% | +1.2% | Moderate |
| **FT%** | 76.6% | 76.2% | +0.4% | Tight |
| 3PTM | 19.4 | 21.6 | -2.2 | Lose |
| AST | 33.4 | 41.8 | -8.4 | Lose |
| ST | 13.4 | 16.8 | -3.4 | Lose |
| TO | 26.0 | 22.6 | -3.4 | Lose |

**Swing category: FT% (+0.4%).** Only category projected to win with less than 1 point of margin. One bad night at the line could flip the matchup to 4-5.

## Remaining Schedule

| Day | Date | Our Players (GPs) | Their Players (GPs) |
|-----|------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Wed** | 2/18 | Adam (Dav), Bowen (Bona), Grahovac (Bona), Mitchell (Bona), Williams (Duq) = **5** | Argabright (Rich), Friedrichsen (Dav), Guinyard (Duq), Marshall (LaSal), Schulte (Ford), Walker (LaSal) = **6** |
| **Fri** | 2/20 | Brown (StL), Tracey (VCU) = **2** | Avila (StL), Lewis (VCU) = **2** |
| **Sat** | 2/21 | Adam (Dav), Bowen (Bona), Mitchell (Bona), Williams (Duq), Hinton (URI) = **5** (Grahovac benched) | Argabright (Rich), Friedrichsen (Dav), Guinyard (Duq), Marshall (LaSal), Schulte (Ford), Walker (LaSal) = **6** |

**GP Budget:** 3 (Tue, done) + 5 (Wed) + 2 (Fri) + 5 (Sat) = **15 / 15**

They have a numbers edge on Wed and Sat (6 vs 5). Friday is even (2 vs 2).

## GP Bench Decision: Saturday

Must bench 1 player Saturday to stay at 15 GP. **Grahovac is the current plan.** Decision should be revisited Saturday morning based on where categories stand.

### Why Grahovac (tentatively)

Grahovac is a strong BLK contributor (+2.92 z, 1.7 BPG) and solid AdjFG% (+1.24 z), but BLK is already a lock (+5.8 margin). If BLK and AdjFG% are safe by Saturday, his production is less critical than the alternatives:

- **Williams** has +1.03 FT% z — valuable if FT% remains the swing category
- **Adam** has +2.05 AdjFG% z — valuable if AdjFG% is tighter than expected
- **Bowen** has +2.82 AST z and +1.36 FT% z — won't flip AST but helps FT%
- **Mitchell** is the highest composite player (+4.95) — never bench
- **Hinton** is the 3PTM specialist (+2.93) — never bench

If AdjFG% tightens up, benching Williams instead is the pivot.

## Waiver Wire Assessment: Stand Pat

Evaluated the best remaining FAs against current roster:

| Player | Team | MPG | Comp Z | P15 Games Left | Verdict |
|--------|------|-----|--------|----------------|---------|
| Brady Dunlap | StL | 17.2 | +0.19 | 1 (Fri) | Worse than Grahovac (+2.01). Helps FT% but loses BLK + AdjFG%. |
| Michael Belle | VCU | 21.6 | +0.14 | 1 (Fri) | FT% z-score of **-1.96** would actively damage our thinnest margin. |
| Ahmad Nowell | VCU | 11.0 | -2.09 | 1 (Fri) | Low minutes, negative across the board except TO. |

**No available FA is an upgrade over any current roster player.** Grahovac (+2.01 composite, BLK specialist) is better than all three. The wire has been picked clean by the Sunday streaming adds.

## Action Items

1. **Today:** Start all 5 available players (Adam, Bowen, Grahovac, Mitchell, Williams). No decisions needed — all fit in 6 active slots.
2. **Friday:** Start Brown + Tracey. Only 2 players available.
3. **Saturday morning:** Revisit bench decision based on updated category margins. Default: bench Grahovac. Pivot to bench Williams if AdjFG% needs protection over FT%.
4. **No waiver moves.** Roster is optimized for the remaining schedule.
