## Round 1 Opponent: Fordham University Christian Knights

### Their Roster

| Player | Team | P15 Games | PPG | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | Z-Comp |
|--------|------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Trey Green | Saint Louis | 2 | 12.1 | 3.2 | 1.8 | 1.0 | 0.0 | +6.86 |
| Kory Mincy | George Mason | 1 | 15.2 | 3.5 | 3.2 | 1.1 | 0.0 | +6.31 |
| Garrett Johnson | George Washington | 1 | 13.0 | 3.9 | 1.2 | 0.5 | 0.2 | +3.17 |
| Amael L'Etang | Dayton | 2 | 11.2 | 5.8 | 1.2 | 0.4 | 1.2 | +1.59 |
| Myles Corey | Rhode Island | 2 | 9.9 | 2.9 | 1.8 | 1.3 | 0.4 | +1.44 |
| Justin Moore | **Loyola Chicago** | **4** | 11.4 | 2.1 | 3.7 | 0.7 | 0.1 | -2.02 |
| Fatt Hill | George Mason | 1 | 10.8 | 3.6 | 2.0 | 0.8 | 0.2 | -1.16 |
| Cameron Crawford | Duquesne | 2 | 5.6 | 2.1 | 1.1 | 0.6 | 0.1 | -2.39 |

**Their GP:** 15 (exactly at cap). They have two elite players (Green +6.86, Mincy +6.31) but Mincy/Hill/Johnson only have 1 game each. Their Loyola Chicago player (Moore) has 4 games but is a weak player (Z: -2.02).

### Baseline Matchup: 4-5 (we lose by 1 category)

| Category | Us | Them | Gap | Status |
|----------|-----|------|-----|--------|
| ST | 12.0 | 11.8 | 0.2 | **WINNING** (barely) |
| TO | 27.4 | 26.9 | 0.5 | LOSING (close) |
| BLK | 3.0 | 4.2 | 1.2 | LOSING |
| AST | 36.8 | 33.0 | 3.8 | **WINNING** |
| 3PTM | 14.6 | 20.8 | 6.2 | LOSING |
| PTS | 171.4 | 162.2 | 9.2 | **WINNING** |
| REB | 65.8 | 47.4 | 18.4 | **WINNING** |
| AdjFG% | .511 | .531 | .021 | LOSING |
| FT% | .724 | .767 | .044 | LOSING |

**We win 4, need to flip 1 more.** Closest flippable cats: TO (0.5 gap), BLK (1.2 gap), AdjFG% (.021 gap), FT% (.044 gap).

## Swap Simulations vs Fordham

### Swap A: Drop Ward, Add Speed (Loyola 4G)

**Result: 4-5 (no change)**

Speed massively boosts our strengths and narrows every gap, but doesn't flip the 5th category. FT% closes to -0.007 and 3PTM closes to -1.0, but both still losses.

### Swap B: Drop Ward+Brewer, Add Speed+Stiemke (Loyola 4G each) -- RECOMMENDED

**Result: 7-2 WIN**

| Category | Us | Them | Margin | Result |
|----------|-----|------|--------|--------|
| PTS | 234.6 | 162.2 | +72.4 | **WIN** |
| REB | 82.8 | 47.4 | +35.4 | **WIN** |
| AST | 53.6 | 33.0 | +20.6 | **WIN** |
| ST | 17.4 | 11.8 | +5.6 | **WIN** |
| 3PTM | 24.6 | 20.8 | +3.8 | **WIN** |
| BLK | 5.0 | 4.2 | +0.8 | **WIN** |
| FT% | .770 | .767 | +.003 | **WIN** (tight) |
| AdjFG% | .505 | .531 | -.026 | LOSS (punt) |
| TO | 35.8 | 26.9 | -8.9 | LOSS (punt) |

Wins 7 categories. Stiemke's elite FT% (+1.30 z) and 3PT (+1.16 z) flip those cats from losses to wins. GP would be 20, so we need to manage sit decisions carefully (only 15 GP allowed).

### Swap C: Drop Ward+Brewer, Add Speed+Theodosiou (Loyola 4G each)

**Result: 5-3-1 WIN**

Wins PTS, REB, AST, ST, 3PTM. Ties BLK exactly. Loses FT%, AdjFG%, TO. Riskier — the BLK tie is fragile and FT% stays a loss.

### Swap D: Drop Ward+Brewer, Add Speed+Adair (Loyola 4G each)

**Result: 5-3-1 WIN**

Wins PTS, REB, AST, ST, 3PTM. Ties BLK. FT% barely a loss (-.002). Similar risk profile to Swap C.

## Recommended Waiver Plan

### Move 1: Drop Tyrell Ward (-4.03) for Braeden Speed (+5.02)
- **Bid: $50** — he's the best free agent in the league with a 4-game schedule
- Net swing: +9.05 composite z-score
- Must-have regardless of which combo we go with

### Move 2: Drop Jerome Brewer Jr. (DTD) for Jordan Stiemke (+2.41)
- **Bid: $25-30** — flips FT% and 3PTM from losses to wins vs Fordham
- Brewer is injured (DTD) and only has 2 games at La Salle
- Stiemke's FT% (+1.30 z) is what pushes us from 4-5 to 7-2

### Budget After R1: ~$20-25 remaining for Rounds 2-3

### GP Management
With Speed+Stiemke we'd have 20 GP (max 15). Sit strategy:
- Bench lowest-value players on days with the most active players
- Prioritize getting full games from Speed, Stiemke, Mitchell, Hinton, Bowen, Henry

## Key Takeaways

1. **R1 opponent is Fordham (#5 seed)** — the most winnable matchup in the bracket.
2. **We already win 4 of 9 categories at baseline** (PTS, REB, AST, ST). Need to flip just 1 more.
3. **Speed alone isn't enough** — narrows every gap but doesn't flip a 5th category vs Fordham.
4. **Speed + Stiemke = 7-2 projected win.** Stiemke's FT% and 3PT are the difference-makers.
5. **Punt AdjFG% and TO** — we can't win these and shouldn't try.
6. **Fordham already has a Loyola player** (Justin Moore, 4G) — we need the double-Loyola pickup to match their volume.
7. **FT% is the swing category** — it's the tightest margin in the Speed+Stiemke scenario (+.003). One bad free throw night could flip it.
