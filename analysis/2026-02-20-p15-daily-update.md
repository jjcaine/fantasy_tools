## What Changed Since Wednesday

Wednesday's projection had us at **5-4** with FT% as the razor-thin swing category (+0.4% margin). Two days later, reality is far better than projected:

- **FT% margin exploded:** .895 vs .676 (+.219) — was +0.4%, now a lock
- **AdjFG% margin exploded:** .580 vs .468 (+.112) — was +1.2%, now a lock
- **3PTM flipped to a win:** 14 vs 11 (+3) — was a projected loss (-2.2)
- **ST flipped to a win:** 10 vs 7 (+3) — was a projected loss (-3.4)
- **AST flipped to a win:** 13 vs 10 (+3) — was a projected loss (-8.4)
- **TO is the only loss:** 14 vs 9 — as expected, conceding this category

Our players massively outperformed their season averages through the first two game days. The result: we hold an **8-1 lead** after 8 GP.

## Full-Week Hybrid Projection: 8-1 WIN (worst case 7-2)

Combined actual results (8 GP) with season-average projections for remaining games (7 GP each). Accounts for Grahovac benched Saturday and opponent benching 1 Saturday player.

| Category | Us (proj) | Them (proj) | Margin | Status |
|----------|----------:|------------:|-------:|--------|
| **AdjFG%** | .563 | .506 | +.057 | Lock |
| **3PTM** | 21.9 | 21.1 | +0.8 | Moderate |
| **FT%** | .834 | .720 | +.114 | Lock |
| **PTS** | 172.2 | 166.0 | +6.2 | Safe |
| **REB** | 57.4 | 51.7 | +5.7 | Safe |
| **AST** | 28.1 | 27.2 | +0.9 | Moderate |
| **ST** | 15.7 | 14.3 | +1.4 | Moderate |
| **BLK** | 3.9 | 0.9 | +3.0 | Lock |
| TO | 25.5 | 18.6 | -6.9 | Locked loss |

**Projected: 8-1 WIN.** Even in the worst-case opponent bench scenario, we project **7-2 WIN** (only losing TO and AST if they bench their weakest AST contributors).

### Sensitivity by Opponent Bench Decision

| Opponent Benches | Projected Result |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Ashton Walker | 8-1 |
| Tarence Guinyard | 8-1 |
| Aiden Argabright | 7-2 (lose AST) |
| Parker Friedrichsen | 7-2 (lose AST) |
| Jaeden Marshall | 7-2 (lose AST) |
| Rikus Schulte | 7-2 (lose AST) |

AST is the only swing category. It's currently +3 through 8 GP but projects to tighten because their roster has higher per-game assist averages (Avila 4.3, Guinyard 5.0, Walker 3.2 vs our best Bowen 4.7, Mitchell 3.1).

## Remaining Schedule

| Day | Date | Our Players (GPs) | Their Players (GPs) |
|-----|------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Fri** | 2/20 | Brown (StL), Tracey (VCU) = **2** | Avila (StL), Lewis (VCU) = **2** |
| **Sat** | 2/21 | Adam (Dav), Bowen (Bona), Mitchell (Bona), Williams (Duq), Hinton (URI) = **5** | 5 of 6: Argabright (Rich), Friedrichsen (Dav), Guinyard (Duq), Marshall (LaSal), Schulte (Ford), Walker (LaSal) = **5** |

**GP Budget:** 8 (done) + 2 (Fri) + 5 (Sat) = **15 / 15** for both teams.

### Today's Game: VCU @ Saint Louis (Friday 2/20)

Head-to-head within a single game:
- **Our Brown vs Their Avila** — both Saint Louis Billikens
- **Our Tracey vs Their Lewis** — both VCU Rams

This is essentially a wash day — both sides have 2 players in the same game. Individual performance determines the fantasy impact. With our massive lead, even a bad day here doesn't threaten the matchup.

## Saturday Bench Decision: Grahovac (Confirmed)

Must bench 1 of 6 Saturday players to stay at 15 GP. **Bench Grahovac** — same recommendation as Wednesday, now even more clearly correct.

| Bench | PTS | REB | 3PM | AST | ST | BLK | TO |
|-------|----:|----:|----:|----:|---:|----:|---:|
| Adam | 172 | 58 | 22 | 28 | 16 | 5 | 26 |
| Bowen | 167 | 57 | 22 | 24 | 15 | 6 | 24 |
| **Grahovac** | **172** | **57** | **22** | **28** | **16** | **4** | **26** |
| Mitchell | 161 | 50 | 23 | 26 | 15 | 5 | 24 |
| Williams | 170 | 58 | 22 | 28 | 16 | 6 | 26 |
| Hinton | 163 | 57 | 20 | 27 | 15 | 5 | 24 |

Grahovac's main contribution is BLK (+1.7/game), which is already a lock (+2 after 8 GP, +3.0 projected). Benching him has almost no impact on any contested category. All other players contribute more to the swing categories (3PTM, AST, ST, PTS).

No reason to reconsider. Bench Grahovac.

## Waiver Wire: No Moves

With an 8-1 lead and 7 games remaining, any roster move risks disrupting chemistry for zero gain. The wire was picked clean by Sunday's streaming adds. No available FA improves the matchup projection.

## Risk Assessment

| Category | Current Lead | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| AdjFG% | +.112 | None | Would need catastrophic shooting collapse |
| 3PTM | +3 | Low | Tight if remaining games regress, but +3 is a solid buffer |
| FT% | +.219 | None | Insurmountable with 7 GP left |
| PTS | +13 | Low | Opponent has slightly higher per-GP average but 13-point cushion is large |
| REB | +4 | Low | Schulte (9.0 RPG) is their main rebounder, but we have Mitchell (9.9) |
| AST | +3 | **Moderate** | Only swing category. Opponent's Avila (4.3), Guinyard (5.0) could close gap |
| ST | +3 | Low | Distributed across our roster, no single dependency |
| BLK | +2 | None | They have 0 blocks through 8 GP |
| TO | -5 | Locked loss | Conceded by design (streaming adds extra TOs) |

**Overall risk: Very low.** The only realistic path to a loss is a historically bad remaining schedule for us combined with a historically good one for them across multiple categories simultaneously. The probability of losing this matchup is negligible.

## Action Items

1. **Today (Friday):** Start Brown + Tracey. Only 2 players available, both auto-start. No decisions needed.
2. **Saturday:** Bench Grahovac, start everyone else (Adam, Bowen, Mitchell, Williams, Hinton).
3. **No waiver moves.** Roster is locked in.
4. **Monitor AST:** The only category with a realistic (but still unlikely) chance of flipping. Check Saturday morning — if AST lead has shrunk after Friday's game, consider benching Adam (lowest AST at 0.7/g) instead of Grahovac (0.8/g) to maximize assists. But this is a micro-optimization that almost certainly won't matter.
5. **Look ahead to Period 16.** With this matchup effectively wrapped up, start scouting the P16 opponent and schedule for streaming opportunities. P16 schedule favors our StBon trio (2 games each) but VCU and Fordham only have 1 game — consider whether a streaming swap of Tracey is needed Sunday.
